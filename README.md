The above demonstrates real-time face emotion recognition using Python. It uses the OpenCV library to draw rectangles around detected faces and overlay text data, displaying the recognized emotion. The DeepFace library, which contains pre-trained deep learning architectures, is used for the emotion recognition task.

The process begins with analyzing a pre-stored image to identify emotions. Then, the code is deployed on a live webcam feed to recognize emotions in real-time. The video addresses challenges in facial emotion recognition, such as imbalanced datasets, variations in images, and issues like occlusion and contrast.

To use the code, you need to install Anaconda, which includes necessary libraries and IDEs like Jupyter Notebook. You also need to install OpenCV and DeepFace using pip. The code loads an image, detects faces using a cascade classifier, and then uses DeepFace to analyze the emotions. Finally, it draws a rectangle around the face and displays the recognized emotion.

As the size of dataset is too huge so I'LL provide the link or details of it
